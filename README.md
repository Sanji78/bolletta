# Bolletta ‚Äî Electricity bill estimation (Home Assistant custom integration)

Custom Home Assistant integration that estimates your **electricity bill** based on:
- a monthly energy consumption sensor,
- PUN price calculation (now computed natively by the integration),
- and a set of configurable parameters (fees, fixed charges, taxes, discounts, TV license, etc.).

**Repository**: `https://github.com/Sanji78/bolletta`  
**Author / Codeowner**: `@Sanji78`

## ‚ú® Main features

- Exposes several **sensor entities** representing bill items (energy fixed fee, energy consumption cost, transport fees, system charges, excise, VAT, total).
- Calculations rely on configurable values (fixed fees, network loss percentage, variable charges, VAT, cashback discount, TV license).
- **PUN (zonal average price) is calculated internally** by the integration; you no longer need to provide external PUN sensors.
- Built with a coordinator (`PUNDataUpdateCoordinator`) and sensors that compute values on update/poll.
- Compatible with Home Assistant via a **Config Flow** (no YAML configuration required).

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Home Assistant (modern versions; integration tested with 2024 era compatibility).
- Python libraries listed in `manifest.json`: `holidays`, `bs4` (BeautifulSoup4).

---

## üîß Installation

### Option A ‚Äî HACS (recommended)
1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed.
2. Go to **HACS ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí ‚ãÆ ‚Üí Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/Sanji78/bolletta` with **Category: Integration**.
4. Install **Bolletta** from HACS and restart Home Assistant.

### Option B ‚Äî Manual
1. Copy the folder `custom_components/bolletta` into your Home Assistant configuration directory:
   ```
   <config>/custom_components/bolletta
   ```
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (UI)

1. In Home Assistant: **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Bolletta** and follow the configuration flow:
   - The config flow will ask for several numeric defaults (fees, charges, VAT, etc.) and **one sensor**: the monthly energy sensor (see requirements below).
   - PUN sensors are calculated natively by the integration, so you do **not** need to add external PUN sensors anymore. If you already have PUN sensors, they may still be used as an override (optional).
   - All values can be changed later via the integration **Options**.

> Note: The integration provides an options flow to update parameters after initial setup.

### Main parameters (options)
- `fix_quota_aggr_measure` ‚Äî Fixed quota: aggregation of measures (‚Ç¨/month)
- `monthly_fee` ‚Äî Monthly contribution (‚Ç¨/month)
- `nw_loss_percentage` ‚Äî Network loss percentage (%) ‚Äî integer 0‚Äì100
- `other_fee` ‚Äî Other fees - Dispatching (‚Ç¨/kWh)
- `fix_quota_transport` ‚Äî Transport fixed quota (‚Ç¨/month)
- `quota_power` ‚Äî Power quota (‚Ç¨/kW/month)
- `power_in_use` ‚Äî Contracted power (kW)
- `energy_sc1` ‚Äî Energy quota Tier 1 (‚Ç¨/kWh)
- `asos_sc1`, `asos_sc2` ‚Äî ASOS variable quotas per tier (‚Ç¨/kWh)
- `arim_sc1`, `arim_sc2` ‚Äî ARIM variable quotas per tier (‚Ç¨/kWh)
- `accisa_tax` ‚Äî Excise duty (‚Ç¨/kWh)
- `iva` ‚Äî VAT (%) (integer 0‚Äì100)
- `discount` ‚Äî Cashback discount (‚Ç¨/month)
- `tv_tax` ‚Äî TV license (‚Ç¨/month)
- `monthly_entity_sensor` ‚Äî **Monthly energy sensor** (must be a `sensor` with device_class `energy` and provide `state` and attribute `last_period`). This is still required: the integration uses this sensor as the primary source of monthly consumption.
- `pun_sensor` ‚Äî *(optional)* Current PUN price sensor ‚Äî NOT REQUIRED as the integration computes PUN natively.
- `pun_mp_sensor` ‚Äî *(optional)* Previous-month PUN price sensor ‚Äî NOT REQUIRED.

---

## üîé Exposed entities (sensors)

The integration creates the following sensors (entity_id):

- `sensor.bill_energy_fix_quote`  
  *Energy expense ‚Äî Fixed fee*  
  Calculation: `fix_quota_aggr_measure * 2 + monthly_fee * 2` (rounded to 2 decimals).

- `sensor.bill_energy_energy_quote`  
  *Energy expense ‚Äî Energy quota*  
  Calculation: `monthly_consumption * ((1 + nw_loss_percentage/100) * pun + other_fee)`  
  If the current month is even (assumption of bi-monthly billing), the previous period is added using the `last_period` attribute from the consumption sensor.

- `sensor.bill_transport_fix_quote`  
  *Transport and meter handling ‚Äî Fixed fee*  
  Calculation: `fix_quota_transport * 2`.

- `sensor.bill_transport_power_quote`  
  *Transport ‚Äî Power quota*  
  Calculation: `quota_power * power_in_use * 2`.

- `sensor.bill_transport_energy_quote`  
  *Transport ‚Äî Energy quota*  
  Calculation: `monthly_consumption * energy_sc1` (+ previous period if month is even).

- `sensor.bill_asos_arim_quote`  
  *System charges (ASOS / ARIM)*  
  Calculation: combines `asos_sc1` (and optionally `asos_sc2`) and `arim_sc1` (and `arim_sc2`) applied on monthly consumption and, if month is even, on the previous period as well.

- `sensor.bill_accisa_tax`  
  *Excise duty (Accisa)*  
  Calculation: `monthly_consumption * accisa_tax` (+ previous period if month is even).

- `sensor.bill_iva`  
  *Total VAT*  
  Calculation: VAT applied to the taxable total.

- `sensor.bill_total`  
  *Total bill*  
  Sum of all items above, VAT, subtract discounts (discount) and add TV license except for November and December (logic present in the code).

### Technical notes about entities
- Unit: `‚Ç¨` (monetary).  
- `state` is a formatted number; integration attempts to set `suggested_display_precision` when supported by HA.
- Sensors use `should_poll = True` ‚Äî they are recalculated when Home Assistant polls them or on manual update.

---

## üßæ Requirements for external sensors

- `monthly_entity_sensor` must be a consumption sensor that provides:
  - `.state` ‚Üí monthly consumption (numeric).
  - `.attributes['last_period']` ‚Üí previous period consumption (used for bi-monthly calculation).
- **PUN sensors are no longer required** because the integration calculates PUN internally. If you prefer, you can still provide `pun_sensor` / `pun_mp_sensor` to override the internal calculation.

If these sensors are missing or don't provide the expected data, calculations may fail or generate errors in the log.

---

## üïò Updates and calculation behavior

- `PUNDataUpdateCoordinator` holds configuration parameters but **does not** force automatic web updates (no `update_interval` set). Individual sensors perform calculations in `manage_update()` and are configured for polling.
- To force recalculation:
  - use the **Refresh entity** action in Home Assistant,
  - or restart the integration/Home Assistant.

---

## üêû Troubleshooting

- If sensors show `unknown` or errors:
  - Check that `monthly_entity_sensor` exists and has numeric value and the `last_period` attribute.
  - Check logs (**Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs**) for entries under `custom_components.bolletta`.
- If `last_period` is not present on the consumption sensor, the bi-monthly logic will not work‚Äîensure the source sensor provides `last_period`.

## üõ† Creating an external monthly consumed kWh sensor (Utility Meter helper)

If you currently have a sensor that provides **daily consumed kWh** (for example `sensor.daily_consumed_kwh`) you can create a **monthly** consumption sensor that stores the previous month's value (`last_period`) using Home Assistant's **Utility Meter** helper. The integration uses the `last_period` attribute to include the previous billing period when needed (bi-monthly billing).

Follow these steps (UI method):

1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Helpers**.  
2. Click **Add Helper** (bottom right).  
3. Choose **Utility meter**.  
4. Fill the helper form:
   - **Name**: e.g. `Monthly energy (from daily)` (this will create an entity like `sensor.monthly_energy_from_daily`).
   - **Source**: select your daily consumed kWh sensor (e.g. `sensor.daily_consumed_kwh`).
   - **Meter reset cycle**: choose **Monthly**.
   - Leave tariffs (if present) empty unless you need separate tariff meters.
5. Save the helper.

What you get:
- A new entity (e.g. `sensor.monthly_energy_from_daily`) that accumulates and resets on a monthly cycle.
- The helper exposes an attribute `last_period` which contains the total consumption of the **previous** cycle (the previous month). You can access it in templates with:
   ```jinja
   {{ state_attr('sensor.monthly_energy_from_daily', 'last_period') }}
   ```
- Use the new helper entity as the `monthly_entity_sensor` in the Bolletta integration configuration.

YAML example (alternative to UI):

If you prefer YAML-based configuration (for installations that still use YAML for helpers), you can add to your `configuration.yaml` (or include file) something along these lines:

```yaml
utility_meter:
  monthly_energy_from_daily:
    source: sensor.daily_consumed_kwh
    cycle: monthly
```

Notes & tips:
- The Utility Meter helper stores the `last_period` attribute automatically. You can use this attribute in templates or set your integration to read it.
- Be aware of timezone / daylight-saving quirks: some users reported the monthly reset happening slightly earlier or later depending on timezone and DST transitions; if your reset appears off by some hours, double-check Home Assistant's timezone setting and the recorder settings. If you need custom reset times, consider using automations to snapshot the current value before reset. (See Home Assistant Utility Meter docs for behavior details.)
- If you need the entity to appear as an energy-type sensor for the Energy Dashboard, make sure the source sensor has appropriate `device_class: energy` and `state_class: total_increasing` metadata where applicable.

- Official Utility Meter integration documentation.  
- Community threads discussing the `last_period` attribute and reset timing.
